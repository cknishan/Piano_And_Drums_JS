# Inspiration/Idea behind app
I love music and programming and so thought of making an app where it is possible to play music. 

## Drums
I searched google and the Drums JS were part of 30DaysOfJavascript by WesBos. I watched the video, absorbed the concept and then coded it myself. 
I also added extra features like responsive design, play by clicking, different way of referencing data key.

## Piano
There's tons of videos on youtube about piano by js. Watched a few but I believe the css code I used is different from all. I made it responsive design and also incorporated the keys and notes correspondingly.

# Learning Experience / Key concepts Implemented
Data-Keys attributes. audio functions. audio object. nodeList vs array. string manupilations. linking local urls. And ofcourse asking better questions at google.

# Further Improvements
- drums does not work with "use strict". so current code is probably not the best practice.
- no piano animations yet.
- play piano with key press.
- about page still empty.
